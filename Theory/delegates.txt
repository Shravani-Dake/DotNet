Delegates

it is reference to a method.
it works like a funcion pointer in c and c++.
for static methods delegate encapsulates method only but 
for instance methods it encapsulates method and instance both
it allows you to reference a method like a variable creating for flexible and dynamic programs.
it binds function and object.
it allows us to access private methods from one class to another class which we cannot access in normal class.
two types of delegates : single cast delegates - we call one delegate to one function
                         multi cast delegates - we call one delegate to multiple functions

for class declaration 
public class test();
for delegates declaration
public delegate void test();
