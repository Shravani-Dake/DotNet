/*
Synchronous : it is synchronous programming.
where task executes one after another. 
each task wait for prevvious task to finish. 
it is sequencial behaviour.
it causes blocking event.
used to wait for task to complete doesnot block thread. 
for example : await Task.Run() => {};

Asynchronous : it is Asynchronous programming.
where task does not need to wait for previous task execution.
it is non sequencial behaviour.
it improves responsiveness.
it does not causes blcoking event. means task can run without blocking main thread.
keywords to declare asynchronous method allows use of await inside the method.
for example : public async task1(){};
