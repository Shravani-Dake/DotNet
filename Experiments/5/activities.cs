/*
Activities : 
1. run program synchronously and measure time. : it will runs each task one after another with given timestamp
2. convert to asynchronous and measure time. : it will run tasks asynchronously means non sequencially. means runs random tasks one by one.
3. replace thread.sleep() with task.delay() observe behaviour. : Behaviour that I  Observed after replacing await Task.Delay(1000);
With Thread.Sleep() : 
it Blocks thread 
Tasks run one by one
Total time ≈ 5 seconds

With Task.Delay() : 
Non-blocking 
Tasks run concurrently
Total time ≈ 1 second
Output order may change randomly

4. create method and returning task.
